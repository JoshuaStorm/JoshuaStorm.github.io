</a>The Coffee Diary</h3>
<p>
    This page will act as my thought dump for coffee shops I visit.
    For background, I have been into third wave coffee since I was a
    in high school and I am a member of my school's coffee club,
    so I am totally an authority here (I'm not).
</p>

<p>
    These "reviews" are mostly just thought dumps, I do not prescribe numbers nor
    do I (in most cases) prescribe whether the place is worth going to. I also don't
    try every beverage at each place, so there are certainly gaps. Expect typos.

<section>
    <a name="Chicago">
        <h2>Chicago</h2>
    </a>

    Caffe Streets
    <ul>
        <li>Has free WiFi, public bathroom</li>
        <li>Got nitro cold brew</li>
        <li>Pretty good but my sample size of nitro cold brew is limited </li>
        <li>Hip space. Not on Milwaukee so less foot traffic. Not ultra comfy but fine for reading/laptop work</li>
        <li>Probably best overall brew experience in the area, nice mug and serving platter thing</li>
        <li>Like I get it's unnecessarily and extra, but they make it really a coffee "experience" and I appreciate it.</li>
    </ul>

    Bru
    <ul>
        <li>Has free WiFi, public bathroom</li>
        <li>ultra commercial. This does result in a lot of comfy seating though, at least for reading</li>
        <li>Got brew coffee</li>
        <li>This brew is pretty bad</li>
        <li>Like wow impressively bad for Wicker Park</li>
        <li>Honestly I should have known and I only went here because the big guys outside Wormhole made me anxious</li>
    </ul>

    Wormhole
    <ul>
        <li>Has free WiFi, public bathroom</li>
        <li>hip af. But not hipster hip</li>
        <li>Still screams gentrified with retro white people stuff and on Milwaukee</li>
        <li>Good lattes IIRC from last year, will have to revisit and update</li>
        <li>Pretty damn good brew. Have a SNES you can play on an old CRT too.</li>
    </ul>

    Dollop
    <ul>
        <li>Uncertain if free WiFi, some locations have public bathrooms. Others don’t. RIP</li>
        <li>multiple locations all throughout the loop - seating ranges heavily from different locations</li>
        <li>Really good vegetarian sandwich</li>
        <li>I’ve had hit or miss lattes. Would generally avoid</li>
        <li>Good brew in my experience</li>
    </ul>

    Stumptown
    <ul>
        <li>Free WiFi. Unclear on bathroom</li>
        <li>Pretty damn good drip with $0.50 refills</li>
        <li>Since this is only about a mile from my apartment I think the refills will make this a go to weekend spot</li>
        <li>I should try a latte cus it’s Stumptown damnit</li>
    </ul>

    Intelligentsia
    <ul>
        <li>Has free WiFi, most don't have public bathrooms</li>
        <li>Multiple locations all across Chicago from the Loop to Logan Square</li>
        <li>Brew and espresso drinks are both good. This is the “step above Starbucks” chain of Chicago to go to for sure.</li>
        <li>Almost always better than Dollop but more expensive</li>
        <li>Avoid the Loop locations if you want to sit for awhile.</li>
        <li>Worth trying the absurd "angeleno:" quad shot, cold milk and agave sweetener shaken makes it a great "dessert drink." If you know me it's pretty telling that I'm even suggesting a "dessert drink"</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="Maryland">
        <h2>Maryland</h2>
    </a>

    Ceremony Coffee
    <ul>
        <li>Has free WiFi, I don't think any of them have public bathroom</li>
        <li>This is the best espresso, brew, and roast I have gotten in Maryland</li>
        <li>Go. Locations in both Annapolis and Baltimore.</li>
    </ul>

    City Dock
    <ul>
        <li>Has free WiFi, public bathroom</li>
        <li>For some reason heralded as the coffee of Annapolis</li>
        <li>Not a third wave shop. Comparable to Starbucks</li>
    </ul>

    Nich's
    <ul>
        <li>Has free WiFi, public bathroom</li>
        <li>Alright so this is in my hometown of Denton, MD and is brand new.
            This place has earned a special place in my heart for opening up
            in a location that is mostly just empty lots ever since the highway
            was built around the town and the local economy effectively collapsed.</li>
        <li>I'm not going to lie, this is not a third wave shop. Brew wasn't very good.
            Latte was tolerable. Nonetheless, very appropriate pricing.</li>
        <li>This place is holding events for teens and adults in the area where very little
            community has existed (contrary to the "small town lifestyle" people imagine).</li>
        <li>Even if the coffee is mediocre at best, this place deserves your patronage. If you're
            ever on the Eastern Shore, drop in and tip well.</li>
    </ul>

    Rise Up
    <ul>
        <li>Has free WiFi, public bathroom</li>
        <li>Another shop that is about more than just the coffee for me.</li>
        <li>They're constantly expanding in Maryland, but I have only been to the one in
            Easton, MD. This was the nearest coffee shop to my hometown throughout high school. </li>
        <li>Fantastic seating great place to blow a Saturday, staff generally doesn't care if you loiter
            way too long.</li>
        <li>Brew and lattes are passable. I wouldn't really call it true third wave, but it sure beats Starbucks.</li>
        <li>Donuts and food truck are both great and reasonably priced.</li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <a name="New Jersey">
        <h2>New Jersey</h2>
    </a>

    Small World
    <ul>
        <li>Has free WiFi, public bathroom</li>
        <li>Plentiful and decent seating.</li>
        <li>Coffee is pretty damn atrocious.</li>
        <li>Aggressively second wave.</li>
        <li>Ask the average Princeton student where to get coffee, and they'll say Small World. They are wrong.</li>
    </ul>

    Rojos
    <ul>
        <li>Two very different locations: one in Princeton (shop) and one in Lambertville (roastery)</li>
        <li>Both have fantastic third wave coffee. Espresso and brew drinks.</li>
        <li>At least in Princeton, this place is very much a "just coffee" shop. They have some pastries
            but I've only seen tourists get them. No public bathroom. No WiFi. Aesthetically pleasing but
            uncomfortable and little seating. </li>
        <li>Miles above Small World.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I need to go to more Philly coffee shops, obviously.
    </p>

    Philter
    <ul>
        <li>Has free WiFi, can't recall bathroom situation</li>
        <li>Located in Kennett Square, this place was my solace from the insanity inducing Exton, PA when I lived there for a summer</li>
        <li>Decent seating</li>
        <li>Only got lattes, but they were pretty good from what I recall</li>
        <li>Pretty good sandwiches too</li>
        <li>Honestly Kennett Square is easily a town you could drive by and not pay any mind to,
            but it's a cute little town and has a nice used book store as well.</li>
    </ul>

        I'm sorry. Good luck.

        If you find anything worth drinking, let alone paying for, please let me know.
