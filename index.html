<p>
  I am a computer science student at Princeton University. I just wrapped up my
  sophomore year as a member of the (great) Class of 2019. I am always curious about
  new opportunities to dive deeper and apply what I've learned. If you're interested
  in more of my formal credentials, <a href="http://becker.codes/resume.pdf">my resume can be found here</a>.
  If you think I'd be a good fit for some opportunity, please send me a quick <a href="mailto:joshua@becker.codes">email</a>!
</p>
<p>
  Aside from computing, I am particularly interested in music. Personally, I
  enjoy electronic music production, composition, and creating installations.
  For those interested in that side of things, <a href="http://becker.codes/music.html">see this page</a>.
</p>
<p>
  My middle name is, in fact, actually Storm. Can you blame me for parading that
  around? I bet if your middle name were Storm you would do the same!

<p>
  This summer I am excited to be interning at <a href="http://www.optiver.com/chicago/">Optiver</a> on the Automated Trading Systems
  team as a software developer. If you're in Chicago and would like to chat about anything, feel free to
  send me an <a href="mailto:joshua@becker.codes">email</a> and we can grab coffee.

  In my free time you will find me finishing up development on the <a href="http://www.snyderphonics.com/index.htm">Snyderphonics MantaMate</a>.
  As well as producing new firmware for the Snyderphonics Genera, a STM37-based digital Eurorack module.
  And, of course, you'll find me playing with my synths and drinking coffee!
</p>

<p>
  The largest non-work project I have worked on this year is
  <a href="https://meetable-us.herokuapp.com/">Meetable</a>: a web application
  for scheduling meetings easily with the help of a users Google Calendar.

  Last summer, I developed a <a href="http://becker.codes/WebSynth/">subtractive synthesizer in the browser</a>.
  I will be the first to say that the user-interface needs some work at the moment,
  but it is still a fun toy to play with.

<p>
  This upcoming academic year I will be continuing my development as a research assistant for
  <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/music/people/display_person.xml?netid=josnyder&">Jeff Snyder's</a>
  <a href="https://snyderphonics.com/">Snyderphonics</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Early this fall I will begin looking out for opportunities for summer 2018.
